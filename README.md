# GameJam-2020

To raise awareness and funds during the COVID-19 pandemic, me and 2 of my friends @Glerind, @DL1793 participated in creating a game for GameJam 2020 Romania. The number of games contributed to the donation amount to the hospitals in Romania.
The project was completed in 3 days and there were many hardships because of the time constraint. 

The game engine used was Unity, my responsability was to develop all the code for the game in C# while my friends did the models and the shaders in Blender.

Nonetheless, it was an amazing challenge and a great experience.
